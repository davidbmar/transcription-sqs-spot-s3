Processing Time: 253 seconds (4.2 minutes)
Speed Factor: 14.3x real-time
GPU Utilization: Full Tesla T4 acceleration
Audio Quality: High-fidelity word-level timestamps with confidence scores
```

## 🐛 Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue #1: cuDNN Library Path Problem
**Symptom:** Worker crashed during GPU warmup
```
Could not load library libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8
```

**Root Cause:** DLAMI has cuDNN in `/usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib/` but PyTorch expects `/usr/local/lib/`

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
# Automated fix added to launch-dlami-ondemand-worker.sh
ln -sf /usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib/libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8 /usr/local/lib/libcudnn_ops_infer.so.8
ln -sf /usr/local/cuda-12.4/lib/libcudnn_ops_train.so.8 /usr/local/lib/libcudnn_ops_train.so.8
```

### Issue #2: FFmpeg Missing for WebM Audio
**Symptom:** Worker crashed on WebM audio files
```
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'ffmpeg'
```

**Root Cause:** DLAMI doesn't include ffmpeg for audio format conversion

**Solution Applied:**
```bash
# Automated fix added to launch-dlami-ondemand-worker.sh  
apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg
```
