# 🌅 Tomorrow Restart Instructions

## Current Status ✅
- ✅ Worker terminated successfully (cost saving)
- ✅ All code committed and pushed to GitHub  
- ✅ PATH 100 (DLAMI) fully tested and validated
- ✅ Real podcast transcription: 60min → 4.2min (14.3x speedup)
- ✅ Critical dependency fixes automated (ffmpeg, cuDNN)
- ✅ Documentation updated with testing results
- ✅ System is now truly "out of the box" ready

## 🚀 Quick Restart Tomorrow

### Option 1: Launch New Worker (Recommended)
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd ~/src/transcription-sqs-spot-s3

# Pull latest updates
git pull origin main

# Source configuration  
source .env

# Launch worker with all automated fixes
./scripts/step-120-launch-dlami-ondemand-worker.sh

# Wait ~3 minutes for startup, then verify health
./scripts/step-125-check-worker-health.sh

# Run real-world benchmark test
./scripts/step-140-benchmark-podcast-transcription.sh
```

### Option 2: Test Other Deployment Paths
```bash
# Try Docker deployment (PATH 200)
./scripts/step-060-choose-deployment-path.sh  # Choose Docker (B)
./scripts/step-200-setup-docker-prerequisites.sh
./scripts/step-210-build-worker-image.sh
./scripts/step-220-launch-docker-worker.sh
./scripts/step-225-check-docker-health.sh
```

### Option 3: Performance Testing
```bash
# Multi-worker scaling test
./scripts/step-120-launch-dlami-ondemand-worker.sh  # Launch 2nd worker
# Submit multiple jobs and measure throughput

# CPU vs GPU comparison
./scripts/step-120-launch-dlami-ondemand-worker.sh --cpu-only
./scripts/step-140-benchmark-podcast-transcription.sh
```

## 📊 What's Now Available
- ✅ **Automated Fixes**: ffmpeg + cuDNN symlinks in worker setup
