# PATH 200: UBUNTU + MANUAL + SPOT
# ========================================================================
# 
# APPROACH: Standard Ubuntu AMI with manual NVIDIA driver installation + Spot instances
# RELIABILITY: Medium (requires proper driver installation + reboot)
# COST: Lower (spot pricing, potential interruption risk)
# SETUP TIME: Longer (manual driver/toolkit installation)
# 
# BENEFITS:
# - Cost-effective spot pricing (50-70% savings)
# - Full control over base operating system
# - Educational value (understand the full setup process)
# - Custom configuration flexibility
# 
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Mandatory reboot after driver installation
# - Robust error handling for spot interruptions
# - Two-phase user-data script (pre/post reboot)
# 
# USE CASE: Development, testing, cost-sensitive batch workloads
