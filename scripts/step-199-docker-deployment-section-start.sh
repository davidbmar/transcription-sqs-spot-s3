# PATH 200: DOCKER GPU DEPLOYMENT 
# ========================================================================
# 
# APPROACH: Docker containerized GPU workers with ECR deployment
# RELIABILITY: High (consistent runtime environment, dependency isolation)
# COST: Medium (on-demand instances for stability, GPU optimization)
# SETUP TIME: Medium (Docker build + ECR push, but automated)
# 
# BENEFITS:
# - Consistent runtime environment across deployments
# - GPU driver compatibility isolation
# - Easy horizontal scaling
# - Simplified dependency management
# - Production-ready containerization
# 
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - Docker support on worker instances
# - ECR repository for image storage
# - GPU-enabled instance types (g4dn.xlarge recommended)
# 
# USE CASE: Production workloads, enterprise deployments, scalable processing
# 
# SEQUENCE:
# step-200-docker-setup-ecr-repository.sh           # Setup ECR repository
# step-201-docker-validate-ecr-configuration.sh     # Validate Docker configuration  
# step-210-docker-build-gpu-worker-image.sh         # Build Docker image with GPU support
# step-211-docker-push-image-to-ecr.sh              # Push image to ECR
# step-220-docker-launch-gpu-workers.sh             # Launch containerized workers
# step-225-docker-monitor-worker-health.sh          # Monitor Docker worker health
# step-235-docker-test-transcription-workflow.sh    # Test with short audio (5 seconds)
# step-240-docker-benchmark-podcast-transcription.sh # Benchmark with real podcast (60 minutes)
# 
# PERFORMANCE: 16.4x real-time speed (60min podcast in 3min 40sec)
