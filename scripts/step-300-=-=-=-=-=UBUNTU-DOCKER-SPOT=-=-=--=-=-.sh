# PATH 300: UBUNTU + DOCKER + SPOT
# ========================================================================
# 
# APPROACH: Standard Ubuntu AMI with Docker containerized deployment + Spot instances
# RELIABILITY: Medium (Docker isolation + manual driver setup)
# COST: Lower (spot pricing, potential interruption risk)
# SETUP TIME: Medium (Docker build + manual drivers)
# 
# BENEFITS:
# - Containerized worker isolation
# - ECR image management and versioning
# - Reproducible deployment environment
# - Easy scaling and updates via container images
# 
# REQUIREMENTS:
# - ECR repository setup and image builds
# - Container restart policies for spot interruptions
# - Host driver installation + container toolkit
# 
# USE CASE: Containerized workflows, CI/CD integration, scalable deployments
